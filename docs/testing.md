## Browser compatibility
To ensure the compatibility and functionality of the system, testing was performed on multiple platforms and browsers. The system was tested on:

- Linux

- Safari Browser

- Samsung Internet Browser 

Since the testing was carried out by external testers on their personal devices, no screenshots were captured during the process. However, the system performed as expected across these platforms and browsers.

Additionally, during testing on Google Chrome, an intermittent error was observed. Occasionally, users received a warning message stating:

“Dangerous site. Attackers on the site you tried visiting might trick you into installing software or revealing things like your passwords, phone, or credit card numbers. Chrome strongly recommends going back to safety. Learn more about this warning.”

This error did not occur consistently and was not reproducible in incognito mode, suggesting that it may be related to browser settings or cached data. The issue did not affect the core functionality of the system, but it was noted for further investigation.
