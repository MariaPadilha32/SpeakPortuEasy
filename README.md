## The-Scope-Plane

The initial plan for this project was more ambitious than the final result. Initially, I envisioned multiple options, templates, and functionalities, but as the project progressed, I realized that some of these features were not feasible within the available timeframe. Adjustments were made to focus on delivering a functional and successful product.

To achieve my goals, I adopted a phased approach to ensure the core features were implemented effectively, with room for improvement in later iterations.

### Initial Development
The project began with a focus on creating the foundational features:
- Home Page: Designed as the entry point, introducing the system's purpose.
- Registration Templates: Developed for managing students, teachers, classes, enrollments, and classrooms.
- Search Pages: Implemented to enable users to retrieve information efficiently.
- CRUD Functionality: Ensured users could create, edit, and delete records seamlessly.

### Iterative Refinements and Incorporating Feedback
After receiving feedback from reviewers, I worked to address the highlighted issues and polish the project:
- Enhanced UI and Navigation: Improved the interface for better usability and consistency.
- Testing and Adjustments: Conducted comprehensive testing to validate that the system met all required criteria.
- Bug Fixes: Resolved issues affecting the functionality and performance of the system.
- Improved README Documentation: Ensured it fully captured the project's scope, features, and usage instructions.

### Agile Planning

The development of this project followed Agile methodologies to maintain flexibility and ensure continuous improvement. While unforeseen family circumstances led to pauses in the project, the Agile framework helped me adapt and refocus when needed. This experience underscored the importance of iterative progress and responsive planning.

**Approach and Tools**

- [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/MariaPadilha32/projects/6)

During the active development phases, I used a detailed Kanban board to manage each step of the project. The Kanban board was divided into three sections: Backlog, Pending, and Done. All user stories were meticulously detailed with expectations and acceptance criteria for each step.

The Kanban board, which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/MariaPadilha32/projects/6) shows the progress and detailed project cards. Each user story includes specific acceptance criteria to define the functionality required for completion.

**User Stories**
Each feature was broken down into user stories with clear expectations and acceptance criteria. Initially, these user stories served as rough guidelines, which were refined as the project progressed. This iterative process allowed for better alignment with project goals and user needs.

**Challanges and Learnings**

- Adapting to Unforeseen Events:
Pausing the project due to personal circumstances taught me the importance of flexibility. By reorganizing tasks on the Kanban board and prioritizing based on impact, I ensured that progress resumed smoothly without losing focus on critical features.

- First Experience with Agile:
As a solo developer, implementing Agile for the first time was a learning curve. While the iterative, collaborative nature of Agile felt unconventional to manage alone, it highlighted the value of incremental progress and self-reflection. The process helped me identify areas for improvement, particularly in planning and execution.

**Key Techniques Used**

- Moscow Prioritization:
I adopted the Moscow prioritization technique to classify requirements into Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have, and Won't-Have. This framework ensured that the most critical features were completed first, balancing scope with available time and resources.

- Time-Boxed Iterations:
I worked in time-boxed iterations focusing on prioritized tasks. This approach allowed me to deliver functional increments consistently, despite the challenges faced.

**Sample User Stories and Tasks**
User stories were instrumental in breaking down the project into actionable tasks. Each story was designed to reflect a specific user goal, providing a clear roadmap for development and testing.
Here are examples of user stories and development tasks completed during the project:

1. User Story 1:
<img src="docs/images/userstory.png">

2. User Story 4:

7. User Story 287:
<img src="docs/images/userstory287.png">

**Reflection and Future Improvements**

While this project introduced me to Agile principles, I recognize that there is room for improvement. For example:

- Increasing the frequency of updates to the Kanban board would have made tracking progress more effective.
- Incorporating formal sprints with clearer objectives could have further streamlined development.

Despite these limitations, the experience has provided invaluable lessons, preparing me to adopt a more structured Agile approach in future projects.

### Access Control for Edit and Delete Features

For security and data integrity, the ability to edit or delete records in the system is restricted to:

1. Admins (Superusers): Administrators have full access to edit and delete all records in the system, regardless of who created them.
2. Record Creators: A user who created a specific record (e.g., Student, Class, Classroom, Enrollment, or Teacher) can edit or delete only the records they created.

**This ensures that:**

Sensitive information remains protected.
Unauthorized users cannot modify or delete records they did not create.

**Other Users:**

- Cannot see the record in the interface unless it is explicitly shared with them.
- Can gain view-only access to a record if they manually enter the record's ID in the URL.
- Even with view-only access, they cannot edit or delete the record.

**This access control implementation ensures:**

- Accountability: Only the appropriate users can modify records.
- Security: Unauthorized users cannot accidentally or maliciously alter or delete records.
- Limited Visibility: Users are restricted from seeing or interacting with records they do not own unless they explicitly access them by ID.

<details><summary>A not authorized user - manually typed the id on the URL</summary>

**Favicon**

A favicon was added the website to enable users to easily locate the website in the browser when multiple tabs are open.

### Features Left To Implement
For future development, the following features are planned to enhance the functionality and user experience of SpeakPortuEasy:

- **Student Homework Uploads:** Enable students to upload their homework directly to the platform. This feature will streamline the submission process and allow teachers to easily review and grade assignments.

- **User-Friendly Attendance Tracking:** Develop a more intuitive and user-friendly page for teachers to manage student attendance. This will provide teachers with better tools to track and update attendance records efficiently.

- **Online Payment for Classes:** Implement a secure online payment system allowing students to pay for their classes directly through the platform. This feature will simplify the payment process and provide a convenient option for students to manage their class fees.

## Deployment and Local Development
The live deployed version of the website can be found on [Heroku](https://speakportueasypp4-342d78e3516e.herokuapp.com/). The following sections detail the deployment process and the technologies used. Instructions for forking or cloning the repository are also provided.

### ElephantSQL Database

The PostgreSQL Database for this project was was set up using [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com),  which you can sign up for using your GitHub account. After signing up, follow these steps:

- Click **Create New Instance** to start a new database.
- Name used: `speakportueasy`.
- Select the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan.
- **Tags** can be left blank.
- Normally you select the **Region** and **Data Center** closest to you in this case EU-West-1.
- For my project, I had to select a differnt region (West-US) as this provided a newer Postgres version that was needed for my project requirements.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL which will be needed for the Heroku Config Vars.

### Amazon AWS

This project uses [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com) to store its media and static files.

Once you've created an AWS account and logged-in, navigate to the **AWS Management Console** page & follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

#### S3 Bucket

- Search for **S3**.
- Create a new bucket, give it a name (matching your Heroku app name), and choose the region closest to you.
- Uncheck **Block all public access**, and acknowledge that the bucket will be public (required for it to work on Heroku).
- From **Object Ownership**, make sure to have **ACLs enabled**, and **Bucket owner preferred** selected.
- From the **Properties** tab, turn on static website hosting, and type `index.html` and `error.html` in their respective fields, then click **Save**.
- From the **Permissions** tab, paste in the following CORS configuration:

	```shell
	[
		{
			"AllowedHeaders": [
				"Authorization"
			],
			"AllowedMethods": [
				"GET"
			],
			"AllowedOrigins": [
				"*"
			],
			"ExposeHeaders": []
		}
	]
	```

- Copy your **ARN** string.
- From the **Bucket Policy** tab, select the **Policy Generator** link, and use the following steps:
	- Policy Type: **S3 Bucket Policy**
	- Effect: **Allow**
	- Principal: `*`
	- Actions: **GetObject**
	- Amazon Resource Name (ARN): **paste-your-ARN-here**
	- Click **Add Statement**
	- Click **Generate Policy**
	- Copy the entire Policy, and paste it into the **Bucket Policy Editor**

		```shell
		{
			"Id": "Policy1234567890",
			"Version": "2012-10-17",
			"Statement": [
				{
					"Sid": "Stmt1234567890",
					"Action": [
						"s3:GetObject"
					],
					"Effect": "Allow",
					"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
					"Principal": "*",
				}
			]
		}
		```

	- Before you click "Save", add `/*` to the end of the Resource key in the Bucket Policy Editor (like above).
	- Click **Save**.
- From the **Access Control List (ACL)** section, click "Edit" and enable **List** for **Everyone (public access)**, and accept the warning box.
	- If the edit button is disabled, you need to change the **Object Ownership** section above to **ACLs enabled** (mentioned above).

#### IAM

Back on the AWS Services Menu, search for and open **IAM** (Identity and Access Management).
Once on the IAM page, follow these steps:

- From **User Groups**, click **Create New Group**.
	- Name: `speakportueasypp4`
- Tags are optional, but you must click it to get to the **review policy** page.
- From **User Groups**, select your newly created group, and go to the **Permissions** tab.
- Open the **Add Permissions** dropdown, and click **Attach Policies**.
- Select the policy, then click **Add Permissions** at the bottom when finished.
- From the **JSON** tab, select the **Import Managed Policy** link.
	- Search for **S3**, select the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy, and then **Import**.
	- You'll need your ARN from the S3 Bucket copied again, which is pasted into the "Resource" key on the Policy.

		```shell
		{
			"Version": "2012-10-17",
			"Statement": [
				{
					"Effect": "Allow",
					"Action": "s3:*",
					"Resource": [
						"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
						"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
					]
				}
			]
		}
		```

- Select the user for whom you wish to create a CSV file.
- Select the **Security Credentials** tab.
- Scroll to **Access Keys** and click **Create access key**
- Select **Application running outside AWS**, and click next.
- On the next screen, you can leave the **Description tag** value blank. Click **Create Access Key**.
- Click the **Download .csv file** button.
    - **IMPORTANT**: once you pass this page, you cannot come back to download it again, so do it immediately!
	- This contains the user's **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**.
	- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` = **Access key ID**
	- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` = **Secret access key**
- These will be needed for the Heroku Config Vars.

#### Final AWS Setup

- Follow the steps described later for [Heroku Deployment](#heroku-deployment) and then return here to follow these final AWS steps below.
- If Heroku Config Vars has `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` still, this can be removed now, so that AWS will handle the static files.
- Back within **S3**, create a new folder called: `media`.
- Inside the media file select **Upload** and **Add Files**.
- Select the images from your hard-drive that you wish to upload.
- Under **Manage Public Permissions**, select **Grant public read access to this object(s)**.
- No further settings are required, so click next through to the end and **Upload**.

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) for deployment to the web. The deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | user's own value |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own postgres value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user's own value |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user's gmail |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `USE_AWS` | True |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file need to be updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

Create a **Procfile** at the root level of the project:

- Open the Procfile and enter the following line of code: `web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi:application` and save.
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*.

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- Ensure Heroku is installed for these following commands to work.
- If it is not run `curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install.sh | sh` in the terminal/CLI.
- Then connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Development
The steps below describe how to fork or clone the repository if desired.
#### How to Fork
1. Log in to Github.
2. Navigate to the [repository](https://github.com/MariaPadilha32/SpeakPortuEasy) for this website.
3. Click the Fork button in the top right corner.
4. You will be brought to a new page with a short form to be completed.
5. Upon completing, click on the "Create fork" button and this will create a fork of the repository in your personal account.

#### How to Clone
1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Navigate to the [repository](https://github.com/MariaPadilha32/SpeakPortuEasy) for this website.
3. Click on the **Code** button and a modal will appear.
4. Within this modal select the local tab.
5. Within this tab there are HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI tabs.
6. Click on the HTTPS tab and copy the link shown.
7. In your development environment open the terminal.
8. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be.
9. Type `git clone` into the terminal, then paste the URL you copied in step 6.
10. Press **Enter** to create your local clone.
11. In the terminal install the requirements by using the following: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
12. If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs to be updated using: `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`.
13. Next create the env.py file which tells our project which variables to use.
14. Add env.py the file to a .gitignore file to prevent it from being pushed to github.
15. Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`.
16. Make migrations by running : `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
17. Then migrate those changes with `python3 manage.py migrate`
18. To view the website type `python3 manage.py runserver` into the terminal and open port 8000.
19. The project is now ready to work on locally and any changes made can viewed using port 8000.
